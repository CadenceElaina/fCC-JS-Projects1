# fCC-JS-Projects1
- This is a website that houses each of the https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/ projects. Each project has its own webpage
with its own interactive application, except the final project Cash Register. This project was not easy to implement and required the user to input 3 different
parameters that are very easy to input incorrectly. I found it much easier to just link the project environment at fCC's website and provide the solution for the 
user. I could probably days to find a reasonable solution and/or simplify the project / input needed, but I would rather spend my time working through the remaining
certifications. 
- I used bootstrap, html, css, and JavaScript in this project. 
- Implementing the projects into a easy to use application for the user was relatively easy. I allowed the user to input data. That data is then set to a variable that is used in the function for that solves the problem for that project. The output is then appended to webpage when the user clicks the button. The user can delete the output with the remove button. 

TODO
- simplify the structure of the project
